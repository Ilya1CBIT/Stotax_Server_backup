Leistungszeitraum Rules:
‘Leistungszeitraum’ must reflect the actual date or period of service provision (not necessarily invoice/payment date).
If a single date of service is shown (e.g., flight date, check-in/out), write this date.
If a period is shown (e.g., multiple dates for flights, hotel stay), write the range: start date–end date.
If multiple segments/services, use the earliest and latest service dates.
If no service date is mentioned, write ‘null’.
Examples:
If invoice date is 27/03/2025, but flight is on 21/08/2025 → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: 21/08/2025(format dd/MM/yyyy).
If hotel stay from 10.06.2025 to 15.06.2025 → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: 10/06/2025–15/06/2025.
If only invoice date is present → ‘Leistungszeitraum’: null"
